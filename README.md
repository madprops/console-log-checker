This allows counting how many lines contain "console.log" in the current document. It also allows removing those lines. If a line matches "console.log" it will remove that line entirely even if there are other things in it. This is done via the commands "Count Console Logs" and "Remove Console Logs". Each command will show output of how many were found or removed. When counting console logs, if some were found the message box will offer to remove them through a button. This won't work correctly with console.log declarations that span through multiple lines. There's also a "Go" button that appears when counting the console logs, when clicked the cursor moves to the first console.log found. Regex used to find them on each line is /(^|\s)console\.log\s*\(/, "g".
